#### Work carried out as part of an introductory deep learning course at Albert School.

## Fruit Quality Classification Project
#### This project uses the Fruit Quality Dataset (FruQ-DB), a collection of images of 11 fruit varieties categorized by their quality: fresh, mild, and rotten.

## Project Description
#### The goal of this project is to develop an image classification model capable of identifying fruit quality from photos.
#### The images were extracted from YouTube time-lapse videos and preprocessed (watermark removed and resized to 224×224 pixels).

## Data Used
#### FruQ-DB: 5,647 images divided into 3 classes:
#### Fresh: 2,182 images
#### Slightly damaged: 1,364 images
#### Rotten: 2,101 images
#### Sample used for training: 100 images per category
#### Fruits included: banana, cucumber, grape, persimmon, papaya, peach, pear, bell pepper, strawberry, tomato, watermelon.

## Repository Structure
#### final_version.ipynb – Main notebook containing preprocessing and model training code.
#### cleaning_black_background.ipynb – Notebook dedicated to image cleaning (removal of black backgrounds).
#### app.py – Script to launch a web application for testing the model.
