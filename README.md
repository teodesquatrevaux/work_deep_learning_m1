## üí° Project Overview

The **Fruit Quality Classification Project** utilizes the **FruQ-DB** (Fruit Quality Dataset) to train an image classification model. This model is designed to determine the condition of a fruit from its image, categorizing it into one of three quality levels.

### Key Features
* **Transfer Learning:** Uses a pre-trained **MobileNetV2** model for high-performance classification.
* **Image Augmentation:** Employs techniques like random flips, rotation, zoom, brightness, and contrast to improve model robustness.
* **Web Application:** Features a simple, interactive **Streamlit app** for real-time testing with user-uploaded images.
* **Data Preparation:** Includes dedicated steps for image preprocessing, notably the removal of black backgrounds.

## üìä Data Used: FruQ-DB

The project relies on the **Fruit Quality Dataset (FruQ-DB)**, a robust collection of images covering **11 fruit varieties** across three quality categories.

| Class | Number of Images | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fresh** | 2,182 | Ready for consumption |
| **Mild (Slightly Damaged)** | 1,364 | Minor signs of damage or decay |
| **Rotten** | 2,101 | Clear signs of spoilage |
| **Total** | **5,647** | |

**Fruit Varieties Included:** Banana, Cucumber, Grape, Persimmon, Papaya, Peach, Pear, Bell Pepper, Strawberry, Tomato, Watermelon.

| Key Training Detail | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Image Size** | 224x224 pixels |
| **Training Sample** | 100 images per category (total of 300 images) |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Repository Structure

This project is organized into the following key files:

| File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `app.py` | **Streamlit Web Application** script for interactive model testing. |
| `final_version.ipynb` | **Main Deep Learning Notebook** containing data loading, preprocessing, MobileNetV2 **Transfer Learning** setup, training, evaluation, and plotting (Accuracy/Loss curves, Confusion Matrix). |
| `cleaning_black_background.ipynb` | Dedicated notebook for initial **image cleaning** and black background removal steps. |
| `requirements.txt` | List of Python dependencies required to run the notebooks and the Streamlit app. |
